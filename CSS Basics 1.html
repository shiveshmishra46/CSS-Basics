<!-- CSS :- It is a language that is used to describe the style of a document.
Basic Syntax :- h1{color: red;} 
In the above basic syntax if CSS the "color" is a property and the "red" is a value, together known as property-value pair.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Level 1</title>
    <!-- This link tag written below is used for linking the HTML file with the CSS file
    If we didn't link the CSS file with HTML file all the styling which we set for the HTML File wouldn't be applied and also wouldn't appeared. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style 1.css">
</head>
<!-- Background Color Property: It is used to set the background color property. -->
<body>
    <!-- Including Style :- 
    * Inline Styling:- 
        <h1 style="color:red"> Shivesh Mishra </h1> 
        Example:- <h1 style="color:red">Hello from Shivesh Mishra!</h1>-->

    <!--* <style> Tag:-
        <style> 
                h1 { 
                    color:red;
                }
        </style>
    This tag and the property is written in the "head tag" of the HTML file and suppose if we apply the
    style on h1 tag of the HTML file then it would be applied on all the h1 tags including in the HTML file.-->
    
    <!-- *External Stylesheet:- (Professional full stack developer mostly prefer this styling.)
        
        By creating another stylesheet file for styling the created HTML file. And using the following syntax we can all do this:-
    Syntax:-

    h1 {
    color : green;
    }
    
    After that we link our HTML page with the created stylesheet file of CSS by using the following link tag.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    We will always use external stylesheet for styling our HTML file and never have to use any "inline" styling in the same HTML file until and unless
    extreme emergency arrived beacause if we use "inline" styling in the same HTML file then the first priority is given to the "inline" style.
    So the professional and very good way is to always use the "External" styling file. -->


    <!-- 
        Foreground Color Property:- 
        Used to set the color of foreground elements.
    Examples of foreground elements: Text, button, link etc. -->

    
    <h1>Hello from Shivesh Mishra!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple and normal paragraph.</p>
    <button>Click Me!</button>

    <!-- 
        Colors:- 
        For some standard and basic colors in HTML we can simply write a name
    of that color to apply them on the desired tag.
    Color Systems:
    RGB System:- Suppose if we want to apply any other color of spectrum which has no specific name
    For this we have to mix the primary and basic colors and type their required
    quantities between 0(min)-255(max) to get the expected color output.
    
    We're get into trouble after getting to know that ww have to learn all the parameters  
    for all the colors of spectrum but we're actually wrong because it is so-so easy,it
    means we just have to search for "color picker" on google and that's it.
    Means, we will get a whole package of colors with their respective parametrs
    we only have to do, to just slide the slider to get the values of "rgb" colors.

    HEX(Hexadecimal) System:- 
        Hexadecimal system is a system which includes numbers from 0-9 and some alphabets from 
    a-f and hence by combining these two we get alphanumeric values of six(6) digits including 
    the hash(#) symbol in starting like, #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff.
    In the above examples in alphanumeric tags the first two digits shows the quantity of red
    color, middle digits shows the green color and last two-digits shows the quantity pf blue
    color.
    WE don't have to remember the HEX(#) code of any color we can just go to google to search for
    many color palette websites and for knowing the best color combinations for our website or any
    projects.

    <!-- 
        Selectors in CSS 
    1. Universal Selector *{ ;} - If we use universal selector then all the properties will be applied on
    whole website.
    2. Element Selector "element name"such as h1 or body etc.{;} - In this, we just write the element name 
    on which we want to apply the properties. Another advantage of element selector in CSS is if inside 
    universal selector we set any element property, then the property is applied on the selected element only.
    3. Id selector( #myid{ ;} ) :- Suppose we want to apply some changes in property of any block of elements then
    we use "id selector" there but it is used only for block elements not for individual or not everytime or 
    every line. It is the habit ofbad programmer 
    4. Class selector - ( .classname { ;} ) :- It is used to apply some change in a particular line.
    In both "Id selector and Class selector" both the properties are used after creating a unique id and class names
    in HTML file.(i.e. id='101', class='myclass')
    

    Text Properties:-
    Text-Align - 
    Used to align some bunch of text in the center, right & left in your website.
    It works in hierarchial format, suppose you want to only a part of paragraph in any of the "div"
    tag in your website then you can also do that wiht thed help of text align tag.

    Text-Decoration- 
    Search mdn website n google on which the use of every tag in CSS is available
    in the documentation. Usually used to underline, overline, line-through(cross cutting over the text.)
    
    Font-Weight - 
    It is used to set font weight to lighter, bold, normal
    It also varies in the range between (100 to 900) where 100 is the lightest and 900 is boldest.
    
    Font-Family - 
    It is used to add font style to the text.
    The available browsers on the internet can only supports some fonts like "arial" etc. But some browsers doesn't
    support some fonts which we used while making our website.
    Then, the solution is we use many font styles while styling our webpage by applying commas like e.g.-
    arial, sans serif etc. If arial is not supported by current web browser then sans serif is applied from
    your stylesteet the application order of fonts is left to right which varies from browser to browser
    And, it is called Fall Back Mechanism.
    There are two types of font styles in CSS font-family:-
    1. Generic Font Families & 2. Specific Font Families.
    For more detail on this, we may search on goole.😊
    

    Units In Css:-  
    It is used to set the size of the text. There are two types of units in CSS
    1. Absolute Units & 2. Relative Units
    Absolute Units:-
    The abolute units are true universally and cannot be different anywhere, it means it
    have same value and doesn't varies from place to place. 
    We can measure in cm, inches etc. in CSS but professionally and mostly we will use
    "pixels"...
    96 pixels = 1 inch and 1 inch = 2.54cm (approx.)
    Relative Uits:- We have discussed it in level 3.
    
    Line-height:- 
    It is used to set the height or space between the lines of a paragraph.
    For normal spacing we can set the line-height to normal.

    Text-transform:- 
    Used to set the case of the paragraph or a text to uppercase(all capital),
    lowercase(all small), capitalize(only first letter of the every text will be capital) & none (for not setting).
