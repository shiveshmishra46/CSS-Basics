        Transitions in CSS 
    Transition enable you to define the transition between two states of an element.
    The transition effect can be applied to the following properties:
    1. background-color
    2. border-color
    3. color
    4. width
    5. height
    6. margin
    7. padding
    8. opacity
    9. top
    10. left
    11. right
    12. bottom
    13. transform
    14. font-size
    15. text-indent
    16. text-shadow
    17. box-shadow
    18. border-radius
    19. outline-color
    20. outline-width
    21. letter-spacing
    22. word-spacing
    23. line-height
    24. background-position
    25. background-size
    26. border-width
    27. border-spacing etc.

    The transition effect is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Opera 12 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Safari 3.1 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Android browser 2.1 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Blackberry browser 7 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Opera Mobile 12.1 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Chrome for Android 18 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Firefox for Android 15 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Safari for iOS 4.2 and earlier versions.
    The transition effect is not supported in Samsung Internet 4 and earlier versions.

    The transition effect is used to create a smooth transition between two different 
    states of an element. You can change the background color of an element on mouse 
    hover, you can change the color, you can change the width, height, margin, padding,
    opacity, top, left, right, bottom, transform, font-size, text-indent, text-shadow, 
    box-shadow, border-radius, outline-color, outline-width, letter-spacing, word-spacing, 
    line-height, background-position, background-size, border-width, border-spacing etc.

    transition-property: Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for.
                         (font-size, color, width, height, or any other CSS property).
    transition-duration: Specifies the duration of the transition effect (in seconds or milliseconds).
    transition-timing-function: Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
                         (linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier).
    transition-delay: Specifies when the transition effect will start (in seconds or milliseconds).

    For applying the transition effect, you must specify the following things:
    1. We need to define the psuedoclass (like hover, focus, active, etc) for the element.
       Pseudoclass is used to define the special & different states of an element.
    2. The CSS property you want to add the transition effect to.
    3. The duration of the effect.
    4. The speed curve of the effect.
    5. The delay of the effect.

    Transition Shorthand Property:-
    property name | duration | timing-function | delay
    transition:   | 1s       | ease            | 0.5s

    CSS Transform Property:-
    Used to apply 2D or 3D transformation to an element.
    The transform property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
    This property will be applied on every content available in the element.

    CSS Scale Property:-
    The scale() function increases or decreases the size of an element.
    Transform : scale(1.5);

    CSS Rotate Property:-
    The rotate property rotates the element clockwise or anticlockwise.
    Transform : rotate(180deg);

    CSS Translate Property:-
    The translate() function moves the element from its current position.
    Transform : translate(100px, 100px);
                          X-axis, Y-axis
    
    CSS Skew Property:-
    The skew() function skews the element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.
    Transform: skew(30deg, 20deg);
                    X-axis, Y-axis
    
    Animation in CSS:-
    CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash.
    An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
    You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
    To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
    Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
    The animation property is used to call the keyframes.
    The animation property is a shorthand property for:
    1. animation-name
    2. animation-duration
    3. animation-timing-function
    4. animation-delay
    5. animation-iteration-count
    6. animation-direction
    7. animation-fill-mode
    8. animation-play-state

    The animation-name property specifies the name of the @keyframes animation.
    The animation-duration property defines how long time an animation should take to complete.
    The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.
    The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.
    The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.
    The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.
    The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).
    The animation-play-state property specifies whether the animation is running or paused.

    Animation is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Opera 12 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Safari 3.1 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Android browser 2.1 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Blackberry browser 7 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Opera Mobile 12.1 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Chrome for Android 18 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Firefox for Android 15 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Safari for iOS 4.2 and earlier versions.
    Animation is not supported in Samsung Internet 4 and earlier versions.

    Animation Shorthand Property:-
    Animation: animation-name | duration | timing-function | delay | iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state;
    Animation: colorAnimate   | 5s       | linear          | 2s    | infinite        | alternate | forwards  | running;

    For example and usage of animation, refer to the file "Style 5.css".

    Percentage in CSS Animation:- 
    In CSS animation keyframes, from means when the work started and to means when the work ended.
    And suppose, you want to apply an effect in between the start and end of the work, then you can use the percentage.
    For example, 0% means the start of the work and 100% means the end of the work.
    And if you want to apply an effect in between the start and end of the work, then you can use the percentage.
    For example, 50% means the middle of the work.

    Bonus Tip:- Always use the shorthand property for transition and animation.
    Always use the vendor prefixes for the transition and animation properties.
    Always use the transition and animation properties with the psuedoclass.
    Always use the transform property with the transition and animation properties.
    Always try to proper use proper formatting while writing the transition and animation properties
    because it will help you to understand the code easily and quickly and it's also a good habit of professional coders.
